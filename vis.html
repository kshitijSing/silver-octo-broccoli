 <h3>Gasket's fractal triangle</h3>
 <img src="sie.gif">
 <p>An interesting pattern emerges if you map out all possible positions in a graph, with lines connecting two positions that differ by a single move. The graph will resemble Sierpinski's gasket; the more disks, the more closely its graph approximates the gasket's fractal triangular shape. The shortest solution is the path along the edge of the triangle, from one corner to the other.</p>
