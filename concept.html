<h1>A recursive definition of a sequence specifies<br></h1>
 <h2>1. Initial conditions<br>
 2. Recurrence relation</h2>
 <h1>Linear recurrences
</h1>
<p> 
Each term of a sequence is a linear function of earlier
terms in the sequence.</p>
<h2>Linear recurrences</h2>
<h3>1. Linear homogeneous recurrences</h3>
<h3>2. Linear non-homogeneous recurrences</h3>
<h1>Linear homogeneous recurrences</h1>
<h3>
A linear homogenous recurrence relation of degree k with
constant coefficients is a recurrence relation of the form<br>
an = c1an-1 + c2an-2 + … + ckan-k,<br>
where c1, c2, …, ck are real numbers, and ck
!=0.<br>
an is expressed in terms of the previous k terms of the sequence,
so its degree is k.<br>
This recurrence includes k initial conditions.
a0 = C0    a1 = C1  …  ak = Ck</h3>
<h1>Solving linear homogeneous
recurrences</h1>
<h3>Let an = c1an-1 + c2an-2 + … + ckan-k be a linear homogeneous
recurrence.<br>
􀀁 Assume the sequence an satisfies the recurrence.<br>
􀀁 Assume the sequence a’n also satisfies the recurrence.<br>
􀀁 So, bn = an + a’n and dn=􀀁an are also sequences that satisfy the
recurrence.
(􀀁 is any constant)</h3>
